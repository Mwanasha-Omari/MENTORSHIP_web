                <h3>A Summery Of <i>Born A Crime</i>By Trevor Noah</h3>
                <p>According to the book Born a Crime Trevor's mother was A woman who valued going to church and insisted that his Son Trevor go church even if he wanted otherwise.
                    Related to my county most parents keep on insisting their children go to church or mosques(madhrasa) which is a requirement mostly from the age of seven.

                    There is gender inequality whereby when Trevor's mother tried to defend her dignity while on the bus. The driver called her an immoral woman because he believed that most women in Xhosa were not submissive, unlike their women. Trevor’s mother's answering back affected his ego and threatened to show her who the man was. In today’s lives in our country where sometimes in public transport the drivers threaten women just because they have boarded their vehicle.  
                    
                    <br> <br>
                    Trevor grew up during the apartheid time when it was illegal to have a relationship between two races, his mother had to hide him from people because they were going to report her hence Trevor, was always in hiding and had no freedom to play with other kids.
                    
                    Trevor’s mother had an option of leaving but did not because South Africa was her origin. We relate this to our current life when one gets the opportunity to leave their country they feel glad keeping in mind that they are going to be successful and get more job opportunities.
                    <br> <br>
                    In conclusion, society keeps on changing but people get more immoral and gender inequality remains a problem in today's lives.
